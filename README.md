# HomeGrown!
## House Plant Owners Unite

### Share care guides and review those of others

Anyone who has ever owned a houseplant knows of their finicky nature.  It seems like the minutest difference in climate, soil condition, watering routine, access to light, etc. (and etc. and etc.) could impact your success with growing a particular plant.
Guides abound with tips from professionals in the field, but their specific experience may not apply to your particular situation.

That's where HomeGrown steps in.

By allowing users to create their own care guides, those details can be highlighted.  With this information in hand, one can more directly choose their sources of guidance and promote helpful posts presented by other users.

### Where to begin

On visiting HomeGrown for the first time, you'll be prompted to create an account.  While not absolutely necessary, signing up is the only way to contribute to the site.  If you merely wish to view what others have contributed, the navigation bar along the left-hand side will direct you to five pages:

    - Users
    - Groups
    - Plants
    - Plant Families
    - Guides

Let's go ahead and sign up, to gain the full experience.  Once logged in, you'll arrive at your home page.  It begins fairly empty, full of potential.  The first place to head is over to **plants**, where you can either link plants others have added to your account or add your own.

or, if you're only know the type of general type of plant you have but would like to see plants grouped by type, you could head over to **plant families**.
