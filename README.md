## House Plant Owners Unite

### Share care guides and review those of others

Anyone who has ever owned a houseplant knows of their finicky nature.  It seems like the minutest difference in climate, soil condition, watering routine, access to light, etc. (and etc. and etc.) could impact your success with growing a particular plant.
Guides abound with tips from professionals in the field, but their specific experience may not apply to your particular situation.

That's where HomeGrown steps in.

By allowing users to create their own care guides, those details can be highlighted.  With this information in hand, one can more directly choose their sources of guidance and promote helpful posts presented by other users.
